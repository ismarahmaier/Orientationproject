# Orientation-Project
I am going to develop a virtual reality experience in a psycho/horror  themed atmosphere. It will be made with Unity3D and built for the HTC Vive and Windows Mixed Reality. 

The storyline will follow The Telltale Heart novella from Edgar Ellen Poe. The sound of the beating heart will be audible for the user throughout the entire experience and will grow louder and louder to enhance the feeling of madness the protagonist of the story is dealing with. 

To increase the immersion and create fear in the user I will rely heaviliy on sound effects and atmospheric music. The story will be told with audio and visual hints like flashbacks, voices, sounds and objects that the user can interact with. By finding these clues about past events the user will advance the storyline and unlock new possibilities. These could for example be new rooms or objects that weren't there before.
